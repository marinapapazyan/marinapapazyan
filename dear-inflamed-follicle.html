		<br>&nbsp;<br>in their work "dear inflamed follicle, there is a commemoration in my skin", marina papazyan draws from their image-based research
		on leprosy, starting firstly from their own skin and then expanding it to the history of the illness in their own family, turkey and the world. they write an intimate
		text on their relationship with the images and narratives that they encounter, and point also at the historical conceptions of leprosy as a
		catalyst for biopolitical domination. they bring together the genetic memory of their skin and that of their own family through photographs. marina also
		refers to the meaning of the skin in terms of contact, conditions of encountering others, the impact of such encounters, and the body as a whole.
