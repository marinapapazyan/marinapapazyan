Before I was born, my skin was already there. Like the moisture I had to part with, something else which was also wet corroded my skin. Corrosion = hyperpigmentation. My skin was a fringe-skin, at the fringes of my kin&#39;s skin. Before the fringes were cut, it was rolled out on a table like dough. Corroded copper plate, beautiful elastic. [...] Lay a World map down to look at it from a distance. It&rsquo;ll say: MAP (break) SHOWING APPROXIMATELY (break) THE PRESENT. It&rsquo;ll be a map showing approximately the present distribution of leprosy in the World. Some areas on this map will coincide with your cheeks. NOTE Countries where the disease is severe are indicated by the deep shade of red; where it is less intense by the lighter shade. Practicing a non-hierarchical approach will be hard. Start by avoiding concentration. The eye is flexible but risks being clunky; once put to rest its movements will become predictable. What we&rsquo;ll need is a wandering eye.
