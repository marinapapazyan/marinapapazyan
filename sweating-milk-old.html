		<text>SWEATING MILK (2019)</text><br>
		<span>poem</span><br>
		&nbsp;<br>
<p style="line-height:2;"><i>Sweating Milk</i> was part of the book <i>Abstract Lies (Chapter 1),</i> which was published in parallel to Huo Rf and Abdi Cadani's exhibition with the same title, curated by Aslı Seven (September 2019, Bilsart, Istanbul).
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<text style="font-size:14px;">EXCERPT</text><br>
most work is maintenance<br>
two very regular cows with ribs so visible<br>
they needed to be injected with hyperproductive fluid<br>
hormones?<br>
not sure but it produces a Holstein cattle<br>
so healthy and efficient that you will love milking<br>
these hyperproductive milk machines<br>
who will have so much diasporic anxiety<br>
that their bodies will be flooding with all kinds of liquids<br>
dams are unable to hold up against<br>
the more this is repressed the more it will come out<br>
in all densities<br>
smells intense<br>
I can hear them ruminating<br>
&nbsp;<br>
modest parentage<br>
as in not deserving to be this troubled<br>
what else<br>
it has always been like this<br>
we too were told that it would all go bad<br>
rancid<br>
in 40 years<br>
in 40 years it will be so bad<br>
now those who were 55 back then<br>
are growing small peppers in front of their window<br>
within the reach of anyone passing by<br>
though enclosed by chicken wire<br>
they still ask you when you will marry<br>
or what makes you sweat milk<br>
I have been cabled wrong<br>
sweat glands milky<br>
scalp itchy<br>
sweaty all over<br>
&nbsp;<br>
you were sweating milk<br> 
when you should have been reaching out<br>
outward<br>
numb my tongue<br>
or rather boil the tongue<br>
and then flatten it<br>
its texture cracked<br>
waterbeds to my saliva spitting<br>
honorable honorary honest spit<br>
I can’t lie<br>
if this sour juice keeps being filled<br>
into my mouth<br>
foreign agent<br>
living a double life<br>
who has two or three names<br>
and hates it<br>
for it has been a guest for too long<br>
emotional national occupation<br>
stop squeezing lemons into my mouth
