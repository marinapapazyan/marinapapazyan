		<p style="line-height:2;">
		&nbsp;<br><i>Dimitri’s Binder</i> is a story that unfolds in the form of a map. The narrative centers on the neighbourhood of Tatavla as it is experienced by Elenitsa, a part-fictional part-historical figure whom Marina first encountered in a 1942 article featured in the Apoyevmatini:<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<i>This year, the carnival ended in a sad mood. (...) At the Ararat Gazino, both the teacher from Pera who had been an avid customer of the carnival festivities for 45 years, and powdered Elenitsa were absent.</i><br>
&nbsp;<br>

The carnival in question is Baklahorani, a masked parade which evoked in the artist a curiosity about the possibilities disguising oneself may have offered in 19th + 20th centuries. The text is an exploration of the changing landscape of Tatavla, literally: as its gardens + agricultural practices + rituals + landmarks are lost, and ephemarally: through its communities whose traditions + rituals + stories + sensibilities wither.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

Elenitsa interprets images + instances + habits + patterns, both fictional and real, with a particular interest in constituting trans narratives through a textual reading of minor evidence + speculation + hearsay.
